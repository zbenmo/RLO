# Reinforcement Learning Observations

Welcome to my RL related blog.

We'll review reinforcement-learning libraries and concepts, and strive
to keep track of the state of the art in the RL arena, and to suggest the best engineering practices.

We'll talk here about **environments** and about **agents**. We'll make **observations** and we will be **rewarded**!
